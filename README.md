===========

Build a jQuery accordion WITHOUT using slideUp, slideDown, or slideToggle. 

Only CSS3 transitions allowed. It should work for 3 or more sections.

Try to use classes and not ID's (except maybe the main element) so that I can easily add more sections as I need to and they will still work.

Make sure to create a new project for this with Yeoman and push it to production. I would also like to see a GitHub pages branch linked to your github.io site. 

Once completed link to that project site below.

Here is a link to what it should look like - http://cl.ly/image/0i3p331P301O/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-16%20at%2012.08.16%20PM.png

- The colors, size etc are up to you but it should follow this format pretty closely.
